<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>TL;DR It's my version of the <a href='http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/'>million dollar homepage</a> but on the blockchain!</p>
<p>Basically it's a smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet hosted at: <i>0xE4cA5542B2fb60c88735165BC655102bdC70BE38.</i> </p><p>The contract premise is simple: 'buy' some customized bytes in exchange for them to be eternalized* on the blockchain. In particular, there are 10 total ad 'slots' each of which has a hard limit of 256 bytes.
</p>
<h3>How do I buy in?</h3>
<p>If there's somehow a free slot, it's as low as the gas fees proportional to your ad's size!</p>
<p>If all the slots are taken, it gets interesting...</p>
<p>Each ad is associated with a duration that can be extended by a fixed amount for a fee. For a particular account, the nth extension fee is $n. E.g. extending an ad's lifetime by 1 day is $1, another day after that costs $2, $3 for the third day, etc and all together 1+2+3=6$ for 3 days. <b>Remember, the number of extensions and therefore the extension fee is tied to a specific account.</b>
<p>Hypothetically, after some time, the cost of owning the adspace is no longer worth the extension cost and so the ad expires :) If you happen to catch a moment like this huzzah the space is yours for now.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why would I want to advertise?</h3>
<p>Some reasons include: </p>
    <ol>
<li><p> no intermediary fees which could be changed at any moment (contract is immutable, pricing is transparent and easily modeled)</p>
<li><p> your string is on the blockchain forever. Any index of the chain/replica will have your string forever, even if it expires at some point.</p>
<li><p> It's a neat way to gauge interest in your message. I.E. if your message doesn't expire for a while, it most likely has many different benefactors and could lead to some interesting analytics.</p>
<li><p> The contract blockchain address blows up and your message gets seen by way more people</p></ol>

<p> Also you'd be supporting my future experiments ;)</p>
